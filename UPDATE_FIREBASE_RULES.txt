⚠️ IMPORTANT: UPDATE YOUR FIREBASE RULES ⚠️
================================================

To enable the Block/Unblock feature, you MUST update your Firebase Database Rules.

QUICK STEPS:
------------
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select your project: "chat-app-9f4f1"
3. Click "Realtime Database" in the left menu
4. Click the "Rules" tab
5. Copy the rules from FIREBASE_DATABASE_RULES.txt
6. Click "Publish"
7. Refresh your chat app

WHY THIS IS NEEDED:
------------------
The blocking feature stores blocked users in a new "blocked" path in your database.
Without updating the rules, Firebase will reject these writes and you'll see the error:
"Failed to block contact. Please try again."

WHAT'S NEW:
-----------
✅ Block contacts (removes from contact list)
✅ View blocked contacts in Settings
✅ Unblock contacts with one click
✅ Blocked users can't appear in your contact list

After updating the rules, the blocking feature will work perfectly!
